<!-- ###  About Me -->

Hola! I'm Sto. Cybersecurity engineering student, Co-founder of [N0PSctf](https://www.nops.re/), Co-president at N0PS, CTF player, Root-Me player, Bug hunter and Pentesting aficionada, I do love finding vulnerabilities in stuff (and flagging!).
Moreover, I am a graphic designer and a web developer (with a soft spot for front-end), as I was keen on arts since I was a kid.
